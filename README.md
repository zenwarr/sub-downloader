Interactive command-line utility to download subtitles from opensubtitles.org.

## Usage

```shell
npx ossub-downloader --lang=eng
```

By default, it searches for video files in the current working directory and uses them to search for subtitles.
But you can specify a video file manually:

```shell
npx ossub-downloader --lang=eng video.mp4
```
